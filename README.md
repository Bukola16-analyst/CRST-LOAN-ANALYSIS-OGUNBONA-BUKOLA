CROWNSTAR MICROFINANCE LOAN PREDICTION ANALYSIS

Introduction

Aim and Objectives of the analysis

The aim of analyzing the loan prediction datasets is to identify the key factors that affect loan approval and default rates, By analyzing past data, the goal is to help the company to make data-driven decisions, reduce risk, and enhance their lending process.

Objectives

The objectives of the analysis are to recognize the factors that influence whether a loan is approved or rejected.

Categorize the loan applicants into different risk categories: high-risk, low-risk to determine the likelihood of loan non-payment and to ease loaning risks.

The objective is also to discover how various factors like income, age, marital status, credit history, years of work experience, and their profession relate with loan approval and repayment success

Problem Being Addressed

Identifying which loan applicants are more likely to default on their loans

Difficulty in predicting whether a loan will be repaid in full and on time.

Ineffective Loan Approval Process, using a loan approval process that can be time consuming or prone to human error

Having doubt about which factors most knowingly influence loan approval or default

Inadequate assessment of applicant risk, leading to the company either approving high-risk loans or rejecting low-risk applicants.

Key datasets and methodologies.

The key datasets used in the analysis

The datasets used contain information about the loan applicants, such as age, marital status, income, years of experience.

Demographic Data: such as profession, current job years, current house years, car

The methodologies

I used Excel’s chart tools to visualize the relationships between different features and loan approval outcomes.

I use bar charts to analyze the distribution of loan approval based on income

I Use line charts to observe trends in loan approval data base on state

I use column charts to analyze Top 6 customers with the highest paid income.

I used Pivot tables to section applicants based on structure like income, ages, years of experience, profession and analyze the distribution of loan approvals or defaults within those segments.

Story of data

Data source: The Data is loan prediction dataset from Kaggle.com.

Data structure: The data is organized into rows and columns, rows in the dataset represents a loan application. Each row matches an individual loan application, and also contains the information about that specific applicant such as personal details, loan features.

columns in the dataset represent the attributes of each loan application, like city, state, profession, current job yrs, experience, customer name, Income, risk flag, car ownership, house ownership.

Important Features and Their Significance:

Income: this is important for evaluating the applicant’s capacity to repay back the loan, this is because higher income levels increase the applicant’s ability to repay back their loan. The company wants to ensure that the applicant has a stable income that allows them to pay back the loan with interest.

Profession: being employed or having an active job provides a signal of a steady income source, and this makes the applicant more reliable in terms of paying back the loan. Unemployed applicants or those with unstable employment may be seen as higher risk of paying back the loan.

Marital Status

Married applicants may have more financial stability and may also have double income and these may increase their chances of paying back the loan, while single person could have a high risk of paying back the loan in cases of income loss.

Age

Age can be used as an indicator of different life phases and stability; young loan applicants like under 25 years may not have enough credit history while older applicant might have more stability, and the company might prefer the older applicants

House Ownership: this can be a sign that the loan applicant is financially stable and also has a strong financial background, the tenant’s applicant may be seen as a higher risk defaulter.

Data Limitations or Biases: The datasets do not contain loan approval status, amount of loan applied for, credit score, all these can affect the results and insights because there won’t be a way to know the applicants loan approval, amount, credit worthiness, as this represents their history of repaying debts

.

Data cleaning: The data sets are clean and well formatted, I manually checked for any errors or inconsistency in the data by carefully observing it, and I observed the data is clean, I make sure the headings are well spelt out, bold, and well arranged. I also make ensure I put the data on a standard excel table because it allows for easy automation and updating

I also ensure I put the currency sign on the income column for proper result, home tab-number ribbon-currency

Data Transformations: the datasets do not consist of applicant’s name, I ensure I transform the data by adding random names of customers

Data splitting:

The datasets were split into two categories: Independent and Dependent variables/values

independent variables include: customer name, city, profession, state.

Dependent variables such as income, years of experience, risk flag, current job years, current house years.

Industry Type/context: the datasets is a loan prediction dataset of a microfinance industry.

Stakeholders of the company are the management team; they are the one that makes strategic decisions for the company,

The company’s core value is making more profits by generating more revenue and that’s the company’s success story.

Analyzing the loan data helps the company to know or recognize which loan applicants are more likely to default on their loans based on income, years of experience, risk flag etc.

To get the optimal age range for highest paying income to help us determine the age range that’s more reliable and trustworthy in the loan repayment and these can help whether the loan will be approved or rejected, as a young age range may not have enough credit history while older applicants might have more savings or assets

To know the highest experience customer, years of experience in a given profession or job may serve as a signal of job instability/stability, which is important for the company to evaluate the applicant’s capacity to repay a loan, loan applicants with more years of experience are often supposed as having greater job stability and have more consistent income, which drops the lender’s risk of default.

Recommendation

I Recommend that High loan offers should be made available to the cities with the high income as these make the loan applicant more reliable in terms of loan repayment.

I Recommend that the company should allocate more loan offers to the customer with the highest paid income because having a steady and high income make the loan applicant more trustworthy and credit worthy in terms of loan repayment.

Though the state West Bengal state is the highest state with high paid income yet they are also the state with the most risk flag and because of that the company shouldn’t approve high loans to customers from the state as this implies that they are not creditworthy in terms of loan repayment.

The highest age range with the highest income is 79 years, and this means a young age applicant may not have enough credit history while older applicants have more savings or assets and this implies that the company should approve high loan for the older applicants more than the younger loan applicant.
